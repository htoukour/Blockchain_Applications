<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Voting in any
government is a key function and allows citizens to participate in
the</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">democratic election
process. Whilst voting has evolved over time into a much more mature</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">and secure process,
it still has limitations that need to be addressed in order to
achieve a</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">desired level of
maturity. Usually, the limitations in current voting systems revolve
around</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">fraud, weaknesses in
operational processes, and especially transparency. Over the years,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">secure voting
mechanisms have been built which make use of specialized voting
machines</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">that promised
security and privacy but they still had vulnerabilities that could be
exploited</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">in order to subvert
the security mechanisms of those machines. This can lead to serious</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">implications for the
whole voting process and can result in mistrust in the government by</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">the public.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Blockchain-based
voting systems can resolve these issues by introducing end-to-end</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">security and
transparency in the process. Security is provided in the form of
integrity and</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">authenticity of
votes by using public key cryptography which comes as standard in a</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">blockchain.
Moreover, immutability guaranteed by blockchain ensures that votes
cast once</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">cannot be cast
again. This can be achieved through a combination of biometric
features and</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">a smart contract
maintaining a list of votes already cast. For example a smart
contract can</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">maintain a list of
already casted votes with the biometric ID (for example a
fingerprint) and</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">can use that to
detect and prevent double casting. Secondly, zero knowledge proofs
can also</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">be used on the
blockchain to protect voters' privacy on the blockchain.</p>
